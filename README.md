# Proposal for error reporting for designspaces

If we have different libraries looking at interpolating systems such as designspaces, it makes sense to have a shared vocabulary for the types of problems that can occur. This data generally is very diverse, font info, kerning info, all the glyph geometry and so on and it comes from different sources. Often edited by different people as well. So improved reporting of problems can help in improving interoperation between tools that edit, validate and generate.

This list of problems is probably not complete. But the numbering system allows for many more problems to be added. The problems are roughly organised from big to small. 

The `designspaceProblems.DesignSpaceChecker` can either read a path or accept a working `ufoProcessor.DesignSpaceProcessor` object.

``` python
  dc = DesignSpaceChecker(designspacePath)
  dc.checkEverything()
  
  # now all problems are stored in dc.problems
  pprint(dc.problems)
  
  # convenience method that checks of the space has
  # problems of categories 0,1,2
  assert not dc.hasStructuralProblems()   # minimum working designspace, ready for fonts
  
  # you can also test for specific issues like so:
  assert (4,7) in dc.problems        # default glyph is empty, glyphName
```

Tests and example code in `/tests/makeTests.py`

The full lists of problems is generated by `designspaceProblems.problems.makeErrorDocumentationTable()` and is [problems.md](problems.md)
